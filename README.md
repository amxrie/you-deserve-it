# Your Productivity Corner

## you-deserve-it

> A productivity app that praises you for the number of tasks you've done and encourages you to reward yourself based on each task's priority level.

A productivity-pointing system for anyone motivated to have rewards for every task they could accomplish. The user can enter their tasks and their corresponding priority and urgency level. The number of points depends on the finished tasksâ€™ level, the higher the level, the higher the points. However, if an unnecessary task were done, there would be a point deduction. They can check their points and the system will offer suggestions for their reward such as rest, ice cream, or buying their favorite food.
